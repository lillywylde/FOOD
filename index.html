  The experience of growing up in Israel is very unlike growing up anywhere else. The culture embodies acknowledgment and eye contact. Islraelis tend to be unashamed about sensuality and sexuality. They are a strong, gutsy people with the ability to connect to their “inner groove” their passion, their pleasure. They face their problems face to face, without any sugar-coating or marshmallow fluff.
